package-installs
================

The package-installs element allows for a declarative method of installing and
uninstalling packages for an image build. This is done by creating a
package-installs.yaml or package-installs.json file in the element directory.

In order to work on Gentoo hosts you will need to manually install
`dev-python/pyyaml`.

example ``package-installs.yaml``

.. code-block:: YAML

  libxml2:
  grub2:
    phase: pre-install.d
  networkmanager:
    uninstall: True
  os-collect-config:
    installtype: source
  linux-image-amd64:
    arch: amd64
  dmidecode:
    not-arch: ppc64, ppc64le
  lshw:
    arch: ppc64, ppc64le

example package-installs.json

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "libxml2": null,
    "grub2": {"phase": "pre-install.d"},
    "networkmanager": {"uninstall": true}
    "os-collect-config": {"installtype": "source"}
    }


Setting phase, uninstall, or installtype properties for a package overrides
the following default values::

    phase: install.d
    uninstall: False
    installtype: * (Install package for all installtypes)
    arch: * (Install package for all architectures)

Setting the installtype property causes the package only to be installed if
the specified installtype would be used for the element. See the
diskimage-builder docs for more information on installtypes.

The ``arch`` property is a comma-separated list of architectures to
install for.  The ``not-arch`` is a comma-separated list of
architectures the package should be excluded from.  Either ``arch`` or
``not-arch`` can be given for one package - not both.  See
documentation about the ARCH variable for more information.

DEPRECATED: Adding a file under your elements pre-install.d, install.d, or
post-install.d directories called package-installs-<element-name> will cause
the list of packages in that file to be installed at the beginning of the
respective phase.  If the package name in the file starts with a "-", then
that package will be removed at the end of the install.d phase.

Using post-install.d for cleanup
================================

Package removal is done in post-install.d at level 95.  If you a
running cleanup functions before this, you need to be careful not
to clean out any temporary files relied upon by this element.
For this reason, generally post-install cleanup functions should
occupy the higher levels between 96 and 99.

features:

  - The ``dib-lint`` tool now has a best-effort sudo check to help
    flag uses of ``sudo`` outside the chroot environment.  This can
    help avoid some classes of breakout problems that can interfere
    with the host system.

  - Running with ``-x`` will give a more verbose log output that
    includes function and line-numbers.  Work is ongoing to further
    reduce noise in the verbose logs to make it as useful as possible.
    Feedback is welcome on the new format.

  - the ``pkg-map`` element can now install different packages based
    on the distribution release.

fixes:

  - Locale stripping for ``yum-minimal`` has been reworked to be more
    reliable for Fedora 23 and CentOS.

  - The Ubuntu Precise kernel is too old to use the online
    ``growroot`` element, so we returned to using
    ``cloud-initramfs-growroot`` in the ``debootstrap`` element for
    it.

  - The ``dib-lint`` tool now better matches python files.

  - The ``apt-sources`` element was fixed to work with the
    ``debian-minimal`` element.

  - Dependencies for the systemd target in ``dhcp-all-interfaces``
    were updated to correctly wait for interfaces.

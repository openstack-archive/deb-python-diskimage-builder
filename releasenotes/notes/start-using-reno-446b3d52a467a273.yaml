fixes:

  - We now use ``fstrim`` rather than ``zerofree`` to reduce final
    image size.  This is considered current best practice.

  - Fix an occasional failure to build ``centos-minimal`` and
    ``fedora-minimal`` due to suspected rpmdb failures.  The main
    symptom was ``dnf`` or ``yum`` thinking packages were not
    installed when they were.

  - The ``debian-minimal`` element now obeys ``DIB_DEBIAN_COMPONENTS``
    for adding components.

  - Fix some issues with Gentoo, and add to supported distributions.
    Testing is currently non-voting

other:
  - Start using reno for release notes

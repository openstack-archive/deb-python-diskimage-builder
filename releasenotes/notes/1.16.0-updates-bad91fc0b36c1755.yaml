fixes:

  - The ``yum-minimal`` element now correctly strips locale-archive
    files, but leaves en.US/en.US-UTF8 for compatibility with remote
    access.  Better failure detection has been added to avoid leaving
    lock files behind if initial installs to the chroot fail.

  - The ``epel`` element was fixed to not incorrectly install EPEL6 on
    Centos 7.  EPEL is added as a requirement of ``centos-minimal``
    (previously, it was tacitly required but not expressed).

  - The ``dib-lint`` tool is now more verbose, has better
    documentation and more correctly detects errors in JSON & YAML.

  - The ``ironic-agent`` element no longer removes the ``sudo``
    package in its cleanup phase.
